Final Project - All Code
Analysis of Wage Inflation Trends and Correlations

For our final project, we looked into wage growth in the United States and 
analyzed how it breaks down and the relationships between the factors that 
contribute to it. This file contains all the code we used to clean, merge, and 
manipulate our data; graphically explore patterns in the relationships between 
certain variables; examine any multicollinearity between variables; and run OLS 
regression to investigate how much certain variables contribute to wage growth.


Our data sources:

Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta - Wage Growth
https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker
- 1998-2024 monthly percent change in wage in the United States
- Contains columns for overall change as well as how wages changed for 
  different worker demographics
